After some time her brother Tom discovers that she and Philip are meeting and brutally forces Maggie to renounce Philip.

Ch. ii. ""Yet few men could be more harmless than poor Marner. In his truthful simple soul^^ not even the growing greed and worship of gold could beget any vice directly injurious to others. The light of his faith quite put out^^ and his affections made desolate^^ he had clung with all the force of his nature to his work and his money; and like all objects to which a man devotes himself^^ they had fashioned him into correspondence with themselves. His loom^^ as he wrought in it without ceasing^^ had in its turn wrought on him^^ and confirmed more and more the monotonous craving for its monotonous response. His gold^^ as he hung over it and saw it grow^^ gathered his power of loving together into a hard isolation like its own."" In his youth he had been an artisan in a large manufacturing town where^^ in spite of the fact that he was subject to occasional cataleptic attacks^^ he led a contented life^^ his strong interests being his membership in a dissenting church^^ his friendship for William Dane^^ and his approaching marriage. Falsely accused of a robbery through his friend's treachery^^ and driven from church and home^^ he had wandered to Raveloe where he settled. With all faith in both men and religion lost through his cruel experience^^ he leads there a lonely life as a recluse and miser^^ his one pleasure the contemplation of the growing hoard of gold which he saves slowly by hard and constant toil. When his money is stolen^^ and the little golden-haired Eppie^^ an unclaimed child^^ comes^^ as he thinks^^ in place of the gold^^ he brings her up as his daughter^^ and through her needs and affection regains his joy in life. Note.—The plot of Silas Marner shows some marked resemblance to a Polish story by Kraszewski called Jermola the Potter. The similarity is most striking in the case of the central figure^^ Jermola^^ a deserted lonely old man left in poverty by the well-to-do family to which he had given a lifetime of service. Like Silas Marner^^ old Jermola finds a deserted infant near his hut^^ adopts it^^ and through love for it and the efforts which he has to make to support it^^ is restored to a happy and useful life.

trust as well as her love^^ and marries him^^ believing that he has the same high ideals as herself. Aside from her love for Tito^^ her devotion to her father is the strongest feeling in her life^^ and after his death she feels it a sacred obligation to carry out his wish to have his library preserved for the city of Florence. Although several things disturb her confidence in Tito^^ her eyes are not opened to his real character until he sells her father's library to the Duke of Milan in violation of what she considers a sacred trust. Believing that this shattering of her love releases her from her marriage vows^^ she decides to leave her husband^^ and is leaving Florence in disguise when she is stopped by Savonarola^^ who tells her that she can not thus break a sacred bond^^ and exhorts her to return and take up work for others if her personal happiness is gone. She yields to his influence^^ becomes one of his devoted followers^^ even though she does not accept all of his religious beliefs^^ and for several years spends herself in good works^^ staying with Tito^^ although their real separation in character and ideals becomes constantly more evident as Tito drifts from one treachery to another. When her godfather^^ Bernardo del Nero^^ is arrested^^ as she fears through Tito's treachery^^ and is executed in spite of her efforts to persuade Savonarola to save him^^ the limit of her endurance is  reached. Disappointed in Savonarola and grief-stricken at her godfather's death^^ she flees from Florence.

And yet there was something fitful in the eyes^^ which contradicted the occasional flash of energy; after looking round with quick fierceness at windows and faces^^ they fell again with a lost and wandering look."" A great scholar and of ample means^^ he had adopted Tito Melema as a child and had brough him up as his own son.

Nothing could be more delicate than the blond complexion—its bloom set off by the powdered hair—than the veined overhanging eyelids^^ which gave an indolent expression to the hazel eyes ; nothing more finely cut than the transparent nostril and the short upper-lip. Perhaps the chin nd lower jaw were too small for an irreproachable profile^^ but the defect was on the side of that delicacy and finesse which was the distinctive characteristic of the whole person^^ and which was carried out in the clear brown arch of the eyebrows^^ and the marble smoothness of the sloping forehead.""

Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Vergin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments^^ which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible--or from one of our elder poets--in a paragraph of today's newspaper.

""The intensity of her religious disposition^^ the coercion it exercised over her life was but one aspect of a nature altogether ardent^^ theoretic and intellectually consequent; and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow teaching^^ hemmed in by social life which seemed nothing but a labyrinth of petty courses^^ a walled-in maze of small paths that led no whither^^ the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration and inconsistency."" Dorothea at nineteen marries the middle-aged and pedantic Mr. Casaubon because she is in love with the idea of being a helpmate to him in his great work. She soon realizes that she has idealized her husband^^ who is a cold^^ jealous^^ and selfish man^^ engaged in a work of no real value. Although the shock of the disilluison is great and her intense nature at times rebels^^ she loyally devotes herself to Mr. Casaubon while he lives. She is on the point of sacrificing her future happiness by making him a promise^^ which^^ though she does not know its nature^^ would have separated her from Will Ladislaw^^ his young cousin^^ when Mr. Casaubon dies. Eventually she gives up her social position and Mr. Casaubon's money in order to marry Will Ladislaw.

""Will Ladislaw's smile was delightful^^ unless you were angry with him beforehand; it was a gush of inward light illuminating the transparent skin as well as the eyes^^ and playing about every curve and line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm^^ and banishing forever the traces of moodiness . . . The first impression on seeing Will was one of sunny brightness^^ which added to the uncertainty of his changing expression. Surely^^ his very features changed their form; his jaw looked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in his nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he turned his head quickly his hair seemed to shake out light^^ and some persons thought they saw decided genius in this coruscation."" His grandmother^^ Mr. Casaubon's aunt^^ had been disinherited because she made a mesalliance^^ by marrying a poor Pole^^ and Mr. Casaubon^^ who feels an inherited responsibility for this^^ had educated Will. With artistic tastes^^ some ability as a writer^^ and a disregard for worldly considerations he has some difficulty in choosing a profession. When he meets Dorothea as Mr. Casaubon's wife he first becomes interested in her^^ and then grows to love her with constancy and devotion^^ and for the sake of being near her settles in Middlemarch as editor of Mr. Brooke's paper. His sense of honour causes him to refuse Mr. Bulstrode's offer of money^^ dishonestly gained^^ which should have been his mother's. When Dorothea^^ after a short widowhood^^ gives up position and fortune to marry him^^ he enters public life^^ without promise of marked success. It has been suggested that some traits in the character of Will Ladislaw were drawn^^ perhaps unconsciously^^ from George Henry Lewes^^ who^^ also^^ was a man of versatile talent and lively manner. Some critics^^ however^^ do not recognize Lewes as the original. Those who consider Lewes as the prototype find one of their arguments in the author's very evident fondness for the character of Ladislaw.

About his ordinary bearing there was a certain fling^^ a fearless expectation of success^^ aconfidence in his own powers and integrity^^ much fortified by contempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he had had no experience. But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression of unaffected good will."" ""His scientific interest soon took the form of a professional enthusiasm; he had a youthful belief in his bread-winning work . . . and he carried to his studies . . . the conviction that the medical profession as it might be was the finest in the world . . . But he did not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He was ambitious of a wider effect : he was fired with the possibility that he might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link in the chain of discovery . . . Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific^^ rational basis of his profession."" He settles in Middlemarch^^ intending not only to be a good doctor^^ but also to carry on scientific investigation^^ for which he is well fitted. Captivated by Rosamond Vincy's beauty and grace^^ he marries her and soon discovers that she is absolutely selfish and unresponsive to his tender love^^ with no sympathy for his high aims. His opposition to accepted medical usages makes him unpopular with the other physicians of Middlemarch^^ and his connexion with Mr. Bulstrode leads him into trouble. His wife has only blame for him^^ and all his endeavours to economize are stubbornly opposed by her. The struggle between him and Rosamond^^ who demands position and luxury at any price^^ ends in the subjection of his higher self^^ and his noblest aims are sacrificed to worldly success. To meet the demands of her ambition he is forced to move to London^^ and become a fashionable physician^^ and dies there at a comparatively early age. The high-minded^^ medical side of Lydgate is said to have been drawn from the Rt. Hon. Sir T. Clifford Allbutt^^ Regius Professor of Physic^^ Cambridge^^ who^^ when Middlemarch was written^^ was head of the Leeds Fever Hospital which George Eliot visited.

""But Mr. Tryan was not cast in the mould of the gratuitous martyr. With a power of persistence which had been often blamed as obstinacy^^ he had an acute sensibility to the very hatred or ridicule he did not flinch from provoking. Every form of disapproval jarred him painfully; and^^ though he fronted his opponents manfnlly^^ and often with considerable warmth of temper^^ he had no pugnacious pleasure in the contest. It was one of the weaknesses of his nature to be too keenly alive to every harsh wind of opinion."" In his youth he had been wild^^ and the realization of his sins had caused him to enter the churoh and to devote his life to others. When he comes to Milby he has to struggle against the indifference of those whom he would help and the malevolent opposition of  Lawyer Dempster. In the end his sympathy^^ faith^^ and high purpose give him the victory^^ for which^^ however^^ he pays with his life. He dies happy in the knowledge that^^ through his influence^^ Janet Dempster has been rescued from despair. There was undoubtedly an original for the story of the persecution of Mr. Tryan.

Its principal street had various handsome and tall-windowed brick houses with walled gardens behind them; and at the end^^ where it widened into the market-place^^ there was the cheerful rough-stuccoed front of that excellent inn^^ the Marquis of Granby . . . And the church was one of those fine old English structures worth travelling to see^^ standing in a broad churchyard with a line of solemn yew-treesbeside it^^ and lifting a majestic tower and spire far above the redand-purple roofs of the town. . . Treby Magna gradually passed from being simply a respectable market-town—the heart of agreat rural district^^ where the trade was only such as had close relations with the local landed interest—and took on the more complex life brought by mines and manufactures."" It has been suggested that in the original of Treby Magna was the ancient town of Coventry^^ in Warwickshire^^ where George Eliot lived for some time^^ but beyond the fact that there was a Coventry original for Rufus Lyon's chapel^^ there seems to be nothing to support this suggestion.

John Justus Transome in 1729 had made a settlement of his estates entailing them on his son Thomas and his heirs-male^^ with remainder to the Bycliffes in fee. Thomas^^ a prodigal^^ had sold his own and his descendants' rights to a lawyer-cousin named Durfey^^ whose descendants^^ the Durfey-Transomes (the Transomes of the story)^^ are the rightful holders of the estate as long as there exists a male descendant of Thomas Transome. In the absence of such male descendant the right to the estate would pass to the Bycliffes. The complicated legal plot of the story rests upon this Durfey-Transome-Bycliffe situation and the fact that Esther Lyon's claim (as the last Bycliffe) becomes valid on the death of old Tommy Trounsem^^ the last descendant of Thomas Transome. In order to be sure that she was right in her handling of a plot based upon a question of law^^ George Eliot consulted Frederic Harrison^^ who suggested the legal scheme of the story and wrote the lawyer's ""opinion on the case""^^ which was incorporated in the novel. Frederic Harrison said later: ""I remember telling her^^ when she inserted these lines in the book^^ that I had written at least a sentence which was embodied in English literature.""

29405,https://georgeeliotarchive.org/items/show/29405,"Lyon^^ Esther","Character Name","A beautiful and charming girl who gives up the wealth and social position that she might claim in order to marry Felix Holt. ""A very delicate scent^^ the faint suggestion of a garden^^ was wafted as she went. He would not observe her^^ but he had a sense of an elastic walk^^ the tread of small feet^^ a long neck^^ and a high crown of shining brown plaits with curls that floated backward — things^^ in short^^ that suggested a fine lady . . . Esther had that excellent thing in woman^^ a soft voice with a clear fluent utterance. Her sauciness was always charming^^ because it was without emphasis^^ and was accompanied with graceful little turns of the head."" ""She had one of those exceptional organizations which are quick and sensitive without being in the least morbid ; she was alive to the finest shades of manner^^ to the nicest distinctions of tone and accent . . . Her own pretty instep^^ clad in a silk stocking^^ her little heel^^ just rising from a kid slipper^^ her irreproachable nails and delicate wrist^^ were the objects of delighted consciousness to her; and she felt that it was her superiority which made her unable to use without disgust any but the finest cambric handkerchiefs and freshest gloves. Her money all went in the gratification of these nice tastes^^ and she saved nothing from her earnings . . . she hated all meanness^^ would empty her purse impulsively on some sudden appeal to her pity^^ and if she found out that her father had a want she would supply it with some pretty device of a surprise."" She had been brought up as the daughter of Rufus Lyon^^ the Independent minister^^ and while fond of her father has little sympathy with his simple tastes and life. Through her father she meets Felix Holt. and while at first repelled by his surface roughness^^ soon becomes interested in him and in the lectures that he gives her. Fearing that she may hear the story from someone else^^ Rufus Lyon tells her that he is not her real father^^ and that she is the daughter of Maurice Christian Bycliffe. She is much touched by his story of his devotion and marriage to her mother^^ and gains a different appreciation of his life and character. Later^^ after she learns that she is the rightful owner of the Transome estates^^ she goes to Transome Court to visit Mrs. Transome^^ and there is courted by Harold Transome. What she sees at Transome Court shows her that wealth does not necessarily bring happiness^^ and as Felix Holt's trial for manslaughter has opened her eyes to the strength of her real feeling for him^^ she gives up her claim to the estate to marry Felix. While George Eliot's portrait of Esther Lyon is not autobiographic to anything like the same extent as that of the character of Maggie Tulliver (in Mill on the Floss)^^ there are some things in it--the fastidiousness^^ niceness about dress^^ etc.-for which the author's own tastes and habits supplied the original.

Rufus","Character Name","The ardent minister of the Independent Chapel in Treby Magna^^ and Esther Lyon's reputed father^^ a man of many lovable oddities and much nobility of character. ""He was walking about now^^ with his hands clasped behind him^^ an attitude in which his body seemed to bear about the same proportion to his head as the lower part of a stone Hermes bears to the carven image that crowns it. His face looked old and worn^^ yet the curtain of hair that fell from his bald crown and hung about his neck retained much of its original auburn tint^^ and his large^^ brown^^ short-sighted eyes were still clear and bright. At the first glance^^ every one thought him a very odd-looking rusty old man; the free-school boys often hooted after him and called him ""Revelations""; and to many respectable church people old Lyon's little legs and large head seemed to make Dissent additionally preposterous. But he was too shortsighted to notice those who tittered at him-too absent from the world of small facts and petty impulses in which titterers live."" ""Once in his life he had been blinded^^ deafened^^ hurried along by rebellious impulse ; he had gone astray after his own desires^^ and had let the fire die out on the altar ; and as the true penitent^^ hating his self-besotted error^^ asks from all coming life duty instead of joy^^ and service instead of ease^^ so Rufus was perpetually on the watch lest he should ever again postpone to some private affection a great public opportunity which to him was equivalent to a command."" Twenty-two years before the opening of the story Rufus Lyon was an eloquent and successful minister of a large Independent Chapel^^ when Annette Ledru came suddenly into his life. The death of her husband^^ Maurice Christian Bycliffe^^ had left her penniless in a strange land^^ and Mr. Lyon took her and her baby into his home^^ in spite of the criticism of his congregation^^ fell deeply in love with her^^ and gave up his high calling to watch over her and her child. After a time the grateful Annette married him and when she died^^ three years later^^ he returned to the ministry^^ and brought up the baby^^ Esther^^ as his own daughter. At the opening of the story he is leading^^ in humble surroundings^^ a life of wrapt absorption in his work and loving devotion to Esther^^ who still believes herself his daughter. When events make him believe that she should no longer be kept in ignorance of her parentage he tells her the full story and leaves her free to decide whether or not she will claim the inheritance and rank to which she is apparently entitled. The original of Rufus Lyon was the Reverend Francis Franklin^^ a Baptist minister^^ who for fifty-four years^^ from 1799 until his death in 1852^^ was pastor of the Cow Lane Chapel^^ in Coventry. Mr. Franklin was the father of the Misses Franklin^^ whose school in Coventry George Eliot attended^^ and the character of Rufus Lyon is said by those who remembered him^^ to be a faithful portrait.

The need of caring for his mother and the consumption which he develops from exposure make him give up the idea of his own leadership^^ and when Daniel Deronda meets him he is living in semi-poverty as a watch mender in the Cohen pawnshop and an off-hour attendant in Mr. Ram's book shop^^ constantly hoping to find the leader on whom his mantle can descend.

And there is something of a likeness^^ too^^ between the faces belonging to the hands--in both the uniform pale-brown skin^^ the perpendicular brow^^ the calmly penetrating eyes."" ""His eyes had a peculiarity which has drawn many men into trouble; they were of a dark yet mild intensity^^ which seemed to express a special interest in every one on whom he fixed them^^ and might easily help to bring on him those claims which ardently sympathetic people are often creating in the minds of those who need help."" ""To say that Deronda was romantic would be to misrepresent him; but under his calm and somewhat self-repressed exterior there was a fervour which made him easily find poetry and romance among the events of every-day life."" As a child he had been brought to England by Sir Hugo and educated as one of his own family. He is sensitive about his ignorance of his parentage^^ though much attached to Sir Hugo whom he believes to be his father^^ and his equivocal position makes him restless and unsettled. At the opening of the story he sees Gwendolen Harleth gambling at Leubronn^^ and his disapproval disturbs her then and influences her later^^ when^^ after her return to England^^ she marries Grandcourt^^ Sir Hugo's nephew^^ and she and Deronda are thus thrown together in the same social circle. While rowing on the Thames Deronda saves Mirah Cohen^^ a beautiful Jewess who is attempting suicide^^ finding a refuge for her with his friends the Meyricks and continuing to watch over her. In his efforts to trace Mirah's lost brother^^ Ezra^^ he forms a strong friendship with Mordecai Cohen^^ becomes interested in Jewish questions through him^^ and eventually discovers that Mordecai is Mirah's brother Ezra and falls in love with Mirah. Meanwhile he feels a different kind of interest in Gwendolen who^^ in the unhappiness of her marriage^^ appeals to him for advice and guidance. When his acquaintance with Mordecai and Mirah has thoroughly aroused his interest in the Jews^^ he is summoned to Genoa to meet his hitherto unknown mother^^ the Princess Halm-Eberstein^^ learns from her that he is a Jew^^ and rejoices in the information. While he is still at Genoa^^ Grandcourt is drowned in the Mediterranean^^ and Deronda supports Gwendolen in her remorse and despair^^ and later she turns to him as her one source of help. On his return to England he devotes himself to work for the Jews^^ marries Mirah^^ and with her goes to Palestine to try to realize Mordecai's dream of a revival of Jewish nationalism. According to Sir Leslie Stephen^^ Edmund Gurney (1847-1888) may have been^^ in sorne respects at least^^ the original of Daniel Deronda.

""This woman's nature was one in which all feeling—and all the more when it was tragic as well as real—immediately be came matter of conscious representation; experience immediately passed into drama^^ and she acted her own emotions. In a minor degree this is nothing un common^^ but in the Princess the acting had a rare perfection of physiognomy^^ voice^^ and gesture."" Brought up by a stern and orthodox father who believed intensely in his race and in the inferiority of women^^ she had come to hate both his authority and the thought of being a Jewess. At her father's wish she had married her cousin Charisi^^ but had bent his gentle nature to her will and had gone on the stage^^ where her wonderful voice and acting made her the leading prima donna of her time. With all her ambition centred on a great career she had no love for her baby (Daniel)^^ and after her husband's early death she persuaded Sir Hugo Mallinger^^ one of her admirers^^ to take Daniel to England and bring him up in ignorance of his birth. Some time after^^ thinking that her voice was failing^^ she married the Prince Halm-Eberstein and retired from the stage.

As the only way of earning money herself which she can find is a hated position as governess^^ she marries Grandcourt in spite of her promise to Mrs. Glasher^^ attempting to quiet her conscience by the plea that she is doing it for her mother^^ to whom she is really attached. The false position in which she finds herself soon makes her unhappy^^ and she turns to Daniel Deronda^^ whose effect on her at Leubronn she has not forgotten^^ for spiritual aid^^ thereby arousing her husband's resentment and jealousy.

In her remorse and despair she turns to Deronda as her only help^^ and from him gradually attains the beginning of a new spiritual attitude and unselfishness. When George Eliot was at Homburg in 1872 she was much impressed by a young lady whom she saw gambling there. This incident furnished the model for Gwendolen Harleth's gambling at Leubronn.

The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength ; yet the long supple hand^^ with its broad finger tips^^ looked ready for works of skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon^^ and justified his name ; but the jetblack hair^^ made the more notice able by its contrast with the light paper cap^^ and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked^^ prominent and mobile eyebrows^^ indicated a mixture of Celtic blood.

Poverty and his father's bad habits had given him much to contend against^^ but with a strong will he had overcome obstacles^^ gained an education in Bartle Massey's night school^^ and made himself a capable artisan^^ respected by his neighbours for his ability and upright character.

He has ideas about timber^^ and his friend Arthur Donnithome ^^ the heir of the manor^^ for whom Adam entertains a strong friendship dating from their boyhood^^ intends to put Adam in charge of the Donnithome woods whenever the old aquire dies.

Later Adam becomes engaged to Hetty^^ but she runs away just before the date set for the wedding. When he learns that she has been arrested and is to be tried for child-murder Adam is overwhelmed with despair^^ and with rage against Arthur. He stands by Hetty in court^^ but is implacable against Arthur for a time^^ although later^^ won over by Arthur's genuine remorse^^ he consents to remain on the estate. Eventually he marries Dinah Morris. It is generally agreed that the character of Adam Bede and some of the incidents of hie career are drawn from Robert Evans^^ George Eliot's father.

""She stood and turned her grey eyes on the people. There was no keenness in the eyes; they seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations; they had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to give out^^ rather than impressed by external objects. She stood with her left hand towards the descending sun^^ and leafy boughs screened her from its rays; but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her face seemed to gather a calm vividness^^ like flowers at evening. It was a small oval face^^ of a uniform transparent whiteness^^ with an egg-like line of cheek and chin^^ a full but firm mouth^^ a delicate nostril^^ and a low perpendicular brow^^ burmounted by a rising arch of parting between smooth locks of pale reddish hair. The hair was drawn straight back behind the ears^^ and covered^^ except for an inch or two^^ above the brow^^ by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows^^ of the same colour as the hair^^ were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the eyelashes^^ though no darker^^ were long and abundant; nothing was left blurred or unfinished. It was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals. The eyes had no peculiar beauty^^ beyond that of expression; they looked so simple^^ so candid^^ so gravely loving^^ that no accusing scowl^^ no light sneer could help melting away before their glance."" She lives at Snowfield^^ where she works in a mill^^ but at the opening of the story she is visiting her aunt at Hayslope^^ where she preaches movingly on the village Green. Seth Bede has long been in love with her^^ but Adam Bede has never seen her until^^ at the time of his father's death^^ she comes to his cottage to help his grief-stricken mother. Her sense of religious duty causes her to try to lead vain little Hetty Sorrel to a higher life^^ and while she produces no religious impression on Hetty^^ she leaves with her a sense of love which makes the girl turn to her later in her despair. Dinah is away from home when Hetty is tried for murder and sentenced to death^^ but she hurries to Hetty's prison as soon as the news reaches her^^ and there prays and talks with the stricken girl until she touches her heart and induces her to make the confession which she had obstinately refused to make. She goes with Hetty to the place of execution^^ and is with her when the reprieve arrives at the last minute. When his grief about Hetty has been somewhat softened^^ Adam Bede discovers that he is in love with Dinah^^ and eventually she marries him. The original of Dinah
Morris was Elizabeth Evans^^ the wife of George Eliot's uncle^^ Samuel Evans^^ al though^^ as George Eliot herself says^^ the character is not an exact portrait. Mrs. Evans^^ whom George Eliot speaks of as ""my Methodist Aunt Samuel""^^ was an eloquent and well-known Wesleyan preacher^^ and some of her characteristics and experiences appear in Dinah Morris. One of Elizabeth Evans's striking experiences^^ when she induced an ignorant girl who had been convicted of child-murder to make a confession^^ and afterwards rode in the cart with her to the place of execution^^ gave George Eliot the idea for the climax of Adam Bede.

""Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit of drab^^ with a red-and-green waistcoat^^ and a green watchribbon having a large cornelian seal attached^^ pendant like a plumb-line from that promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey-ribbed stockings^^ knitted by Mrs. Poyser's own hand^^ setting off the proportions of his leg.

"" Do not suppose^^ however^^ that Mrs. Poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance; ahe was a good-looking woman^^ not more than eight-and-thirty^^ of fair complexion and sandy hair^^ well-shapen^^ light-footed: the most conspicuous article in her attire was an ample checkered linen apron^^ which almost covered her skirt; and nothing could be plainer or less noticeable than her cap and gown^^ for there was no weakness of which she was less tolerant than feminine vanity^^ and the preference of ornament to utility. The family likeness between her and her niece Dinah Morris^^ with the contrast between her keenness and Dinah's seraphic gentleness of expression^^ might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and Mary. Their eyes were just of the same colour^^ but a striking test of the difference in their operation was seen in the
demeanour of Trip^^ the black--andtan terrier^^ whenever that muchsuspected dog unwarily exposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs. Poyser's glance.

""She has the spirit of three men^^ with that pale face of hers; and she says such sharp things^^ too."" ""Sharp I yes^^ her tongue is like a new-set razor. She's quite original in her talk^^ too; one of those untaught wits that help to stock a country with proverbs. I told you that capital thing I heard her say about Craig--that he was like a cock who thought the sun had risen to hear him crow. Now that's an Aesop's fable in a sentence."" She is a pattern dairywoman and housekeeper^^ with standards of excellence which none of her much-berated maids^^ even under the spur of her sharp tongue^^ ever succeeds in living up to. She keeps her eyes open for her neighbours' foibles and weaknesses^^ summing them up in keen^^ though homely^^ epigrams^^ and is strict with her husband's niece^^ Hetty Sorrel^^ whom she rightly suspects of selfishness and vanity. When the parsimonious Squire Donnithorne tries to impose upon her good-natured husband^^ Mrs. Poyser ""speaks her mind^^ to the Squire^^ routing him in a battle of words which delights the whole neighbourhood. In spite of her sharp tongue she is a kindly woman^^ much attached to her family and fond of her niece Dinah Morris^^ whose saintliness she appreciates though she does not approve of her Methodism and self-denial. For several of Mrs. Poyser's traits—her kindliness^^ shrewd common sense^^ and witty tongue —George Eliot's own mother^^ Mrs. Robert Evans (Christiana Pearson) was the original. Mr. John W.

""There is one order of beauty which seems made to turn the heads not only of men^^ but of all intelligent mammals^^ even of women. It is a beauty like that of kittens^^ or very small downy ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills^^ or babies just beginning to toddle and to engage in conscious mischief--a beauty with which you can never be angry^^ but that you feel ready to crush for inability to comprehend the state of mind into which it throws you. Hetty Sorrel's was that sort of beauty."" ""It is of little use for me to tell you that Hetty's cheek was like a rose--petal^^ that dimples played about her pouting lips^^ that her large dark eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes^^ and that her curly hair^^ though all pushed back under her round cap while she was at work^^ stole back in dark delicate rings on her forehead^^ and about her white shelllike ears; it is of little use for me to say how lovely was the contour of her pink-and-white neckerchief^^ tucked into her low plum-coloured stuff boddice^^ or how the linen butter-making apron^^ with its bib^^ seemed a thing to be imitated in silk by duchesses^^ since it fell in such charming lines^^ or how her brown stockings and thick-soled buckled shoes lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly have had when empty of her foot and ankle; of little use^^ unless you have seen a woman who affected you as Hetty affected her beholders^^ for otherwise^^ though you might conjure up the image of a lovely woman^^ she would not in the least resemble that distracting kittenlike maiden ... Hetty's was a spring-tide beauty; it was the beauty of young frisking things^^ round-limbed^^ gambolling^^ circumventing you by a false air of innocence."" Although she has been brought up by Mr. Poyser as if she had been his own daughter^^ she is incapable of feeling any gratitude and affection for him or his family. Her beauty attracts village suitors^^ including honest Adam Bede^^ whom her uncle favours^^ but she believes that her beauty destines her for a higher station. When she attracts the attention of the young squire^^ Arthur Donnithome^^ she sees a rosy future for herself^^ ignorantly thinking that his passion^^ to which she has secretly yielded^^ must end in marriage. When Arthur Donnithome breaks off his affair with her she is humiliated and sick at heart^^ but^^ later^^ seeing nothing better in the future^^ promises to marry Adam who is in ignorance of what her real relations with Arthur have been. As the time for their marriage approaches^^ Hetty realizes that the truth must soon come to light^^ and^^ under pretence of visiting Dinah Morris at Snowfield^^ journeys to Windsor to find Arthur Donnithome and then not finding him^^ journeys back in despair^^ lacking the courage to kill herself^^ but determined to keep her disgrace from her family.

Dinah accompanies her to the place of execution^^ and at the last minute Hetty's sentence is commuted to transportation^^ from which she never returns. While Hetty herself is not a portrait^^ her tragedy^^ and^^ indeed^^ the germ of the plot of Adam Bede^^ were taken from a dramatic experience in the life of George Eliot's aunt^^ Elizabeth Evans (""Dinah Morris"").
